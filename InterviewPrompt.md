We are designing a 2D game and we have a game map that we represent by an integer matrix. For now, each cell can be a wall (denoted by -1) or a blank space (0).

board = [
  [0,  0,  0, -1, -1],
  [0,  0, -1,  0,  0],
  [0, -1,  0, -1,  0],
  [0,  0, -1,  0,  0],
  [0,  0,  0,  0,  0],
  [0,  0,  0,  0,  0],
  [0,  0,  0,  0,  0],
]

The player can move 1 space at a time up, down, left, or right. The player can't go through walls or land on a wall, or go through the edges of the board.

Write a function that, given a board and a player starting position (represented as a row-column pair), returns all of the possible next positions for the player.

Sample inputs (board, starting_position) and outputs (in any order):

findLegalMoves(board, (1, 1)) =>
  (0, 1), (1, 0)

findLegalMoves(board, (5, 3)) =>
  (5, 2), (5, 4), (4, 3), (6, 3)

findLegalMoves(board, (5, 1)) =>
  (6, 1), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 2)

findLegalMoves(board, (6, 0)) =>
  (5, 0), (6, 1)

findLegalMoves(board, (6, 4)) =>
  (5, 4), (6, 3)

findLegalMoves(board, (0, 0)) =>
  (0, 1), (1, 0)

findLegalMoves(board, (2, 2)) =>
  [empty]

n: width of the input board
m: height of the input board
